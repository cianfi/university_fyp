# University Final Year Project
This is the Final Year Project for my degree, "Network Engineering". 


##Â Objective
The objective of this Git Repository is to create a working flow from collecting data from network devices, to alerting when issues occur, to utilising an AI agent utilising a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, or in this case for now "phi3:mini", which contains 3.8 billion parameters. 


## Future Ideas for this project. 
As an engineer, there are many routes I want to explore once I have built out a minimal viable product. The first is the use of different LLMs and seeing the results. The second is using other types of artificial intelligence, such as the following:
    - Graphical Neural Networks (GNN)
    - LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Documentation
All the documentation will be put into the documents folder. This might not be updated as of now, however when the MVP is built, the documents such as process, reasoning etc will be located here.
